# Hello World!
**... in many computer languages.**

This Repository contains programs written in many different computer languages producing `Hello World!` as output.
It is similar to [leachim6/hello-world](https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world) except that this repository includes fully working and runnable sample projects. These projects are tested with docker whenever possible. 

This project also includes a README.md for each computer language with usefull information and links to get started. 

Feel free to contribute!


## Structure of Repository
Every computer language has its own folder named after it. The folder contains a file named `HelloWorld-<language name>` with an example printing `Hello World!` to console.
The `README.md` file contains information about the language and useful links.
In any case it should contain the release date, what the language is designed for, supported operating systems, a introduction how to build and run the code and a short guide (or link to a guide) for getting in touch with this language for the first time.


## Contributing
Feel free to contribute. Thats all for now. Just open a PR and add a new language or example project and create or update the `README.md`. You might update Dependabot if its supports your build system.
